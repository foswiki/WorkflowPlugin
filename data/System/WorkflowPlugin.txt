Foswiki provides a flexible system of Access Control Lists that can be used to control who can modify a topic. Sometimes this isn't quite enough, and the access control depends on the state that a topic is in.

For example,
   * When writing documents compliant with ISO 9000 (e.g. a quality manual), it is essential that documents are approved by quality control
   * In a defect tracking data base, defects typically transition through a series of states, from submission to resolution, with different actions available depending on the state of the defect.
   * In a journal database, papers must be reviewed and approved by several experts in the field before being allowed to be published.

<nop>WorkflowPlugin lets you associate a state with a topic and then control what other states that the topic can move to. You can define a set of _states_ for controlled topics (e.g. "under revision", "waiting for approval", "approved") and _transitions_ (e.g. "revise", "approve") between these states. Furthermore, you can define which users/groups are permitted to perform specific transistions.

A workflow can be associated with a single topic, or with an entire web. 

<div class="foswikiHelp">
*Upgrade note* If you are upgrading from a version before 10 Nov 2008 please note that the format of the WORKFLOWHISTORYFORMAT preference has changed slightly, in that:
   1 enclosing double quotes are no longer removed from the value. This changes has been to bring this preference definition into line with other preference definitions.
   1 =$n= is interpreted as \n, not &lt;br&gt;, in line with the standard [[%SYSTEMWEB%.FormatTokens][format tokens]]. If you want a &lt;br&gt; in the format string, then enter it as &lt;br&gt; or $percntBR$percnt.
</div>

---++ Usage

A topic is under document control if the preference variable =WORKFLOW= is set
in the topic page. =WORKFLOW= must be set to the wiki name of a topic that describes your specific workflow (the _workflow description topic_).

Note: you can hide the setting in a normal view using HTML comments, or better, you can put these settings into the local topic settings, accessible from the "more" screen.

---+++ Settings in the workflow description topic 

The workflow description topic must contain one state table and one transition table. The state table describes the possible states a document may be in (nodes in the flow diagram above), and the transition table describes how documents move between states (arcs in the flow diagram).

This is easiest illustrated using an example (available as Sandbox.DocumentApprovalWorkflow if the plugin is installed).

The state table is a table with three columns:

<verbatim>
| *State*       | *Allow Edit* | *Message* |
| UNDERREVISION | QualityGroup | This document is being revised. |
| APPROVED      | nobody       | This document has been approved for release. |
| WAITINGFORQM  | nobody       | This document is waiting for approval by the Quality Manager. |
| WAITINGFORCTO | nobody       | This document is waiting for approval by the CTO.|
</verbatim>

Each row in the table defines a state where:
	* the *State* column specifies a name for the state, 
	* the *Allow Edit* column specifies who is permitted to edit the topic when it is in the state, and 
	* the *Message* column defines a message which can be displayed on the document page when the document is in this state.

In the example we have defined four states. Members of the
!QualityGroup are permitted modify documents can make changes to the document
in UNDERREVISION state. In all other states, nobody is allowed to edit the
controlled document.

The first state in the table is the initial/default state.

%X% The state table must be defined *before* the transition table!

The transition table consists of four columns, as in this example:
<verbatim>
| *State*       | *Action* | *Next State*  | *Allowed*                        |
| APPROVED      | revise   | UNDERREVISION | QualityGroup                     |
| UNDERREVISION | complete | WAITINGFORQM  | QualityGroup                     |
| WAITINGFORQM  | approve  | WAITINGFORCTO | QualityManager                   |
| WAITINGFORQM  | reject   | UNDERREVISION | QualityManager,QualityGroup      |
| WAITINGFORCTO | approve  | APPROVED      | TechnicalDirector                |
| WAITINGFORCTO | reject   | UNDERREVISION | TechnicalDirector,QualityManager |
</verbatim>

Each row in this table defines a transition from one state to another state:
	* the *State* column contains the name of a state from the state table, 
	* the *Action* column describes a possible action when the topic is in
      this state,
	* the *Next State* column defines the new state of the document after
      the specified action has been performed,
	* the *Allowed* column specifies who is allowed to perform the
      corresponding action,
	* an _optional_ *Form* column defines a form that is attached to
      the topic in this state.
	* an _optional_ *Notify* column specifies who should be notified when this transition fires.

In our example, anyone is allowed to revise the document when it is in =UNDERREVISION= state. After finishing the revision, the document can be transitioned to the =WAITINGFORQM= state by any member of the !QualityGroup. It must then be approved by the !QualityManager, and after that by the !TechnicalDirector. Even though they can't edit the document themselves (see state table above), they _can_ reject the revision and put the document back into the =UNDERREVISION= state. The !TechnicalDirector can transition the document to =APPROVED= state where it rests until a member of the !QualityGroup puts it under revision again.

If a form name is given in the *Form* column, this form will be attached to the topic, and the topic will put in edit mode to allow information to be provided in the form _when that state transition happens_. In the example above, a form of type Approved<nop>Form will be attached to the topic when the CTO transitions the topic into =APPROVED= state.
   * if there is already a form of a different type attached to the topic, then any fields that have the same name in the _new_ form will be preserved.
   * If no form is given, the existing form (if any) is left in place.
A typical usage of the form would be to collect additional information as the topic walks through the work flow, or to make information in the form unchangeable (by setting it to a =label= field) once a given state is reached.

If a *Notify* column is given, that column can contain a comma-separated list of notification targets to be informed when the transition is fired. You can specify values in any combination of the following formats:
| *Format* | *Example* | *Notes* |
| Email addresses | webmaster@example.com | |
| User wiki names | Main.WikiGuest | |
| Wiki group names | Main.AdminGroup | |
| Workflow Attribute names | LASTUSER_APPROVED | LASTUSER_{State} |
| Email templates | =template(!Web.MyTopic)= | Must be wrapped in parentheses and proceeded by the word =template=, all lowercase, no spaces. |

When a transition is fired, any email addresses provided in the *Notify* column (or resolved from wiki/group names) will be notified, with a message formatted according to the default email template provided with the plugin.  You can override this template by setting the =WORKFLOWDEFAULTEMAILTEMPLATE= preference in your workflow description topic.  Set that to a topic that contains a valid email notification template (see example below), and all email addresses provided will receive messages formatted according to that template:

<verbatim>
From: %WIKIWEBMASTERNAME% <%WIKIWEBMASTER%>
To: %EMAILTO%
Cc:
Subject: %WIKITOOLNAME%.%WEB%.%TOPIC% - transitioned to %TARGET_STATE%
Auto-Submitted: auto-generated
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

%WIKINAME% has moved the topic %WEB%.%TOPIC% to the %TARGET_STATE% state.  You can view the document here:
%SCRIPTURL{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%
</verbatim>

Email notification templates should be topics formatted like the example above, with the headers each on their own line, followed by a single colon, then their values, with the message body beginning below the first blank line.  Also note the =%EMAILTO%= macro on the =To:= line; any email addresses pulled from the *Notify* column for a given transition will be expanded here.  If you override the default email template using the =WORKFLOWDEFAULTEMAILTEMPLATE= preference, it *must* use the =%EMAILTO%= to pull in recipients, otherwise you'll need to provide your own macros, and any email addresses provided in the *Notify* column _will be ignored_.  See the [[%%BASETOPIC%#Content_45sensitive_workflows][content-sensitive workflows]] section for more on how !WorkflowPlugin expands macros.

For more sophisticated email notification, you can also write one or more custom email templates for each transition. Custom notification templates can either provide valid headers that define their recipients or access the =EMAILTO= macro, so other email addresses provided will be sent exclusively through custom templates.

For example, the *Notify* column in the transition below will email =jim@example.com= using the default template, and execute both the =EmailOne= and =EmailTwo= templates, sending the results to whatever email addresses are defined on their respective =To=, =Cc=, or =Bcc= lines:
<verbatim>
| *State* | *Action* | *Next State* | *Allowed* |  *Notify*                                               |
| PENDING | approve  |   APPROVED   |           | jim@example.com, template(EmailOne), template(EmailTwo) |
</verbatim>

*Note:* it's a good idea to avoid editing email notfication templates with a WYSIWYG editor, as they are somewhat fragile.  

---+++ Settings in your controlled document/topic 

As described above the topic needs to contain a definition for the variable =WORKFLOW= for it to be controlled under the approval workflow. This is best set as a document-specific preference setting in the =More topic actions= screen.

%INCLUDE{VarWORKFLOW}%

If you replace =%<nop>EDITTOPIC%= with =%<nop>WORKFLOWEDITTOPIC%= in your skin templates, then the _Edit_ link is crossed out when the user is not allowed to edit the page in a state.

Similarly, you can use =%<nop>WORKFLOWATTACHTOPIC%= in your skin templates to cross out the _Attach_ link.  

---+++ Content-sensitive workflows
*Advanced* Flows can be made sensitive to the content of the controlled
topics. The 'Allow Edit' column in the state table, and the 'Next State'
and 'Allowed' columns in the transition table, support the use of macros
which are expanded
when the topic is viewed. For example, you can use the =[[VarMETA][META]]=
macro to pick up values for these fields from the form attached to the
viewed topic:

*State table*
<verbatim>
| *State*             | *Allow Edit*                         | *Message* |
| WAITINGFORAPPROVAL  | %META{"formfield" name="MayModify"}% | This document is waiting for approval |
</verbatim>
*Transition Table*
<verbatim>
| *State*            | *Action* | *Next State*                             | *Allowed*                        |
| WAITINGFORAPPROVAL | approve  | %META{"formfield" name="ApprovedState"}% | %META{"formfield" name="MayApprove"}% |
</verbatim>

If you want to exclude the user who changed a specific state last, even though the user is generally allowed to, you can add =not(LASTUSER_{State})= to the =Allowed= column of the transition table and the last user for the specified state will be excluded.

You can also define other macros starting with =WORKFLOW= in the workflow
description topic. These will be expanded to their defined values in any
topic that uses the workflow. For example:
	* Set WORKFLOWNOTICE = This topic is under document control.
will define =WORKFLOWNOTICE= in any topic that uses the workflow.

---++ Reporting
A common requirement is to report on the status of topics that are in different states in the workflow. You can use the query search to search for topics in a specific state. For example, to search for all topics in state "APPROVED":
<verbatim>
%SEARCH{"META:WORKFLOW.name='APPROVED'" type="query"}%
</verbatim>

---++ History and Acknowledgements

This plugin was motivated by [[Foswiki:Main.ThomasWeigert][Thomas Weigert]]'s [[Foswiki:Extensions.WorkFlowAddOn][WorkFlowAddOn]] and its first version (then called !ApprovalPlugin) was written by Thomas Hartkens, albeit it was focused on document approval and control. [[Foswiki:Main.ThomasWeigert][Thomas Weigert]] then merged the functionality of the [[Foswiki:Extensions.WorkFlowAddOn][WorkFlowAddOn]] into this plugin.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

__Note:__ The script =[[%ATTACHURL%/convert.pl.txt][convert.pl.txt]]= will convert topics written for the !ApprovalPlugin to the !WorkflowPlugin. The script takes a topic at the standard input and outputs the converted topic on standard output. Rename the file from =convert.pl.txt= to =convert.pl=.

Look at the examples in the !Sandbox web.

__Note:__ For strict access control, the plugin should know who is looking at the controlled document/topic at all times.  To enable this, you may want to set up the wiki in such way that users have to log-in *even if they just display a topic*.
